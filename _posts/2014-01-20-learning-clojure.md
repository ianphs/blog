title: Learning Lisp (as in Clojure and Clojurescript)

Recently I've started learning _Clojure_ and _Clojurescript_. Variants of _Lisp_.

It took me longer than it need have.

Here is the process I should have followed:

* Entertain the possibility that some unlikely things might just turn out to be true; not true enough to invalidate your present knowledge; but true enough to create whole new vistas in addition.
* Entertain the possibility that a programming language exists which is so different from any you know, that it is _really hard_ to understand its assumptions.
* Read the first 6 pages of [_On Lisp_ by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) not with a view to believe it, but just to know that some people do believe these things.
* Do a very fast read of one of these two books. Not to study, not to remember, just to do a really fast read right through. Slow your reading only during the section which explains how to call the _add_ function. i.e. the expression (add 2 3) has a value 5 because it calls the _add_ function with 2 parameters. Observe also that _+_ is another way to spell _add_ so the expression may also be written as (+ 2 3), i.e. the expression (+ 2 3) has a value 5 because it calls the _+_ function with 2 parameters. The two books are (read one only, and read it fast), [Clojure Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Programming-Chas-Emerick-ebook/dp/B007Q4T040) and [Programming Clojure](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Clojure-Stuart-Halloway/dp/1934356867
* (Optional step) A video of general interest. [Daniel Spiewak - Living in a Post-Functional World](http://vimeo.com/user18356272/review/66548717/3531875329)
* Install the java JDK.
* Install [lein](http://leiningen.org/)
* Do 6 of the 20 lessons in [Clojure Koans](http://clojurekoans.com/)
* Skim through at least 6 of the posts in the blog [dosync](http://swannodette.github.io/archive.html)
* Watch the first 15 minutes of the video at [clojurescreencasts.com](http://clojurescreencasts.com/koans-walkthrough/01.html)
* Install [Light Table](http://www.chris-granger.com/lighttable/) and use it a bit, read some of its documentation.
* Do the rest of the 20 Clojure Koans lessons using the method of  [clojurescreencasts.com](http://clojurescreencasts.com/koans-walkthrough/01.html)
* Consider doing the tutorials to replace javascript. [Modern Clojurescript](https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs)
