When the author decided that _Jonah_ would flee west to Spain, he was doing what Tolkien and Shakespeare do.

He was crafting a story not about God, but about man.

_Jonah_ reminds us of ourselves. He fears humiliation. When the hated Assyrians repent, as they surely will, then God is bound to forgive them. And all the bluster of Jonah will seem so foolish then. Better to leave the Middle East and flee far to the west, all the way to Spain.

It is really a very short story, but oh so telling. Jonah is finally changed by a simple plant, and so Jonah changes his mind about himself. Perhaps it is not so humiliating after all.

_Jonah_ is remembered in Christianity, Islam and Judaism. And loved in all. As history, the story is entirely fictional, though set in an actual century (the 8th B.C.) and in an actual city (Nineveh in what is now northwestern Iraq). But in the language of the heart, it is as true as any story ever told.

---------------

Where Islam and Christianity meet, we see the life of a very small monastic community (just 8 monks I think) in the Atlas Mountains of Algeria, in the middle 1990s. There are guerrillas, there is a repressive army, there is a battered Muslim population, and there is the tiny monastic community of Christians. The Christians revere Islam, the Moslems love the Christians. It is a slow, extraordinary movie which has been received to wild acclaim.
