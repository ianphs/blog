Amid all the claims and counter-claims about U.S. government spying on the citizens of the world, it is difficult to arrive at absolute certainties. However, some things are starting to become clearer.

When governments spy, not only the guilty suffer, plenty of innocent bystanders suffer too. You and me perhaps. All those trigger-happy cops enjoy showing how tough they are.

The _war on terror_ relies on us all believing that terrorists pose a large risk to our safety. It is interesting to discover that, if you live in America, you are 10 times likelier to die of food poisoning, 50 times likelier to die in a drunk-driving accident, 100 times likelier to be killed by a gun, 20 times likelier to drown in a bathtub, 200 times likelier to die in a building fire and 4 times likelier to die struck by lightning.

"Mostly harmless," said the Encyclopedia Galactica entry on Earth. President Obama thinks the collection of metadata about phone calls is entirely harmless. Yet a simple illustration makes it clear that it is precisely as harmful as the practice by which soldiers entered any house without a warrant in the American colonies in the time of King George III.

Somebody is lying. But who? Amid all the conflicting statements, it is most confusing. The most plausible theory is that many people, including President Obama, Larry Page of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook are _fomally_ remaining within the literal bounds of truth by most selective and carefully worded evasions. This theory is well explored in [Connecting The PRISM Dots: My New Theory](http://uncrunched.com/2013/06/11/connecting-the-prism-dots-my-new-theory/)

It seems Amazon, Twitter and Salesforce are not cooperating except to the extent forced. It seems that the following companies are being extremely helpful to the U.S. government and its employees and contractors: Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, YouTube and Skype.

That means there are more than a million U.S. government employees and contractors who may read every private email we send, every chat message, every anything. Am I going to trust that each of those million is honest? Will I trust Larry Page or Mark Zuckerberg or Barack Obama?

What can we do? What should we do?

* learn how to encrypt _all_ our communications, our emails, our chats, everything
* sharply reduce our reliance on those companies showing enthusiasm for spying, namely: Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, YouTube and Skype
* reduce our reliance on any U.S. company, because even small companies or uncooperative big ones like Twitter can in fact be coerced by one of those million employees and contractors of the U.S. government 
* read the novel _1984_ by George Orwell; learn how lies operate; learn how you and me might be tricked
* observe how proud Obama is that foreigners have no rights; not Britons, not Australians, not Italians, not Egyptians, not Africans, not Chinese...
